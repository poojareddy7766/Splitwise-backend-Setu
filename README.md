## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/poojareddy7766/Splitwise-backend-Setu.git 
cd Splitwise-backend-Setu 
```

### 2. Create the PostgreSQL Database

Make sure PostgreSQL is running on your machine. Then, create a database named splitwise_db:{Replace your_username with your actual PostgreSQL username.}
```
createdb -U your_username splitwise_db
```
### 3. Update Database Credentials (replace your username and password)
```
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```
### 4. Flyway Configuration for Database Migrations (replace your username and password)
```
user = 'your_username'
password = 'your_password'
```
### 5. Run the Flyway Migration
```
./gradlew flywayMigrate
```
### 6. Build the project

```
./gradlew build
```

### 7. Make sure docker is running 

```
open -a Docker
```

### 8. Build the Project using docker 
```
 docker build -t splitwise-backend .
```

### 9. Run the Application
```
 docker run -p 8080:8080 splitwise-backend          
```

The application will start on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
